### Wh- Questions

Another type of questions are the Wh- questions. They are called this way because normally they begin with Wh- (why, when,...) even though another of the same type, How...? does not share the same pattern. They cannot be answered with a simple Yes or No, unlike the ones we've seen before. Here are some usual interrogative particles -

* Who? - Quem?
* What? - Que?
* Where? - Onde?
* When? - Quando?
* Why? - Por que?
* How? - Como?

> **Examples:**

> * Who is the U.S. President? _The U.S. President is Joe Biden. (Joe Biden)_
> * What do you use to write? _I use a pen to write. (A pen)_ 
> * What currency do you use in Brazil? _We use the Brazilian Real. (The Brazilian Real)_
> * Where do you live? _I live in Salvador. (In Salvador)_
> * How do you go to Itaparica? _I go to Itaparica by boat. (By boat)_
> * When do you watch television? _I often watch TV from 13:30 to 14:45._
> * Why do you go to Itaparica? _I go to Itaparica to visit my grandfather. (To visit my grandfather)_

### Questions with the 3rd Person Singular

We can also use the structures previously mentioned to ask things about other persons, about cities or even about countries. We just need to change the pronoun _you_ for the name of this other person (or city, or country, or...) and use _does_ instead of _do_.

> **Examples:**
> * Where does the Pope live? _He lives in Vatican City._
