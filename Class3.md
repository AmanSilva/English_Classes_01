### Wh- Questions

Another type of questions are the Wh- questions. They are called this way because they usually begin with Wh- (why, when,...) even though another of the same type, How...? does not share the same pattern. They cannot be answered with a simple Yes or No, unlike the ones we've seen before. Here are some of the interrogative particles that start these questions -

* Who? - Quem?
* What? - Que?
* Where? - Onde?
* When? - Quando?
* Why? - Por que?
* How? - Como?

> **Examples:**
> * Who is the U.S. President? _The U.S. President is Joe Biden. (Joe Biden)_
> * What currency do you use in Brazil? _We use the Brazilian Real. (The Brazilian Real)_
> * Where do you live? _I live in Salvador. (In Salvador)_
> * When do you watch television? _I often watch TV from 13:30 to 14:45._
> * Why do you go to Itaparica? _I go to Itaparica to visit my grandfather. (To visit my grandfather) / I go there because I like visiting my grandfather. (Because I like visiting my grandfather)_
> * How do you go to Itaparica? _I go to Itaparica by boat. (By boat)_

### Questions with the 3rd Person Singular

We can also use the structures previously mentioned to ask things about other persons, about cities or even about countries. We just need to change the pronoun _you_ for the name of another person (or city, or country, or...) and use _does_ instead of _do_.

> **Examples:**
> * Where does the Pope live? _He lives in Vatican City. (In Vatican City)_
> * When does Brazil celebrate its independence? _Brazil celebrates its independence on September the 7th. (On September the 7th)_
> * How does Manoel play chess? _He plays chess against his computer._
